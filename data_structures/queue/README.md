## Queue data structure

- A queue can be implemented with an array and a linked list.

Queue data structure follows <u>First In First Out (FIFO)</u> principle. Imagine standing in a line in a coffee shop, the first person added to the line is served coffee first.

Methods that a queue data structure has: -

1. <u>enqueue</u>: add element to the end of the array,
2. <u>dequeue</u>: removes element from the start of the array,
3. <u>peek</u>: returns first element without removing it,
4. <u>isEmpty</u>: checks if the array is null,
5. <u>size</u>: returns the size of the array,
6. <u>print</u>: prints all the elements
