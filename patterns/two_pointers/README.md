## Two pointers pattern

- <u>Data structure</u>: Array, string (often), linked list(sometimes).
- <u>Pointer</u>: a variable representing index or position in, for example, an array.

With multiple pointers, we can do comparisons without relying on multiple loops. Two common stratigies for this pattern is: -

1. <u>Converging pointers</u>: pointers start at opposite end and move inwards,
2. <u>Parallel pointers</u>: pointers start at the same end and move in the same direction (different speeds or different criteria for pointer movement).

If the time complexity of an algorithm is O(N^2), two pointer pattern reduces the time complexity of the algorithm by O(N).
